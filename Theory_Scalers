#Standard scalar module:
In python from sklearn.preprocessing features by removing the mean, and scaling to unit variance.

FORMULA:
--------
 Xscaled=x-mu/sigma

  where x is orginal feature value

  mu mean of feauture column

  sigma - std deviation of feauture column

This ensures that mean should be 0 and a standard deviation of 1

            compute the mean for each column

            compute the standard deviation for each column

            apply  the standardization xscaled
            x=[[10],[20],[30],[40]]
            mean=100/4 = 25

            standard deviation :/ calculate Xscaled value
            sqrt(((x1-25)^2+(x2-25)^2+(x3-25)^2+(x4-25)^2)/(No.of values))=15

            we got mu and sigma value now substitute values

            x1-m/sigma,x2-m/sigma,x3-m/sigma,x4-m/sigma

#min-max scaler:
--It is the a feature scaling technique provided by sklearn.preprocessing it transforms feautures to a fixed range 0 and 1.

--It is used in ML to ensure that all features have same scale,improving the model performance.

xscaled=x-xmin/xmax-xmin
x=[[10],[20],[30],[40],[50]]
x-original value

FOR FEATURE RANGE(-1,1):
-------------------------
Xscaled=(x-xmin/(xmax-xmin))*(b-a)+a

USAGE OF MINMAX SCALER:
-------------------------

1. when feature ranges vary siginificantly and need to be brought to a uniform scale.
2. when data is not normally distributed unlike standardscaler when assumes normality
3. when using distance-based ml models(ex: KNN,K-Means,SVM)
where feature magnitude effects distance calculations
4. when input values must be bounded (ex:Neural networks benefits from [0,1] scaling)


#maxabs scaler:
---------------

    It is used to feactures scaling, its scale each feature by its maximum absolute value, ensuring all values fall with in the range of (-1,1) without the distorting original distribution.

    Xscaled= Xi/max(|X|)
    
    ex:[10,20,30,40,50]

    10/50 =0.2
    
    20/50=0.4

    30/50=0.6

    40/50=0.8
    
    50/50=1


#Robust Scaler:
----------------

    It is used for scaling numerical data by removing the median value and scaling it based on interquartile range(QR). It makes it robust outliers, unlike standard scaler which is affected by extreame values.

  FORMUlA:
  -------
  Xscaled= X-Q2/Q3-Q1
      here x is original value

      Q1,Q2,Q3 are quartile values

      Q1 is first quartile value - 25% value

      Q2 is median value  -50% value

      Q3 is IQR -75% value

      IQR=Q3-Q1


ex: [1,2,3,4,5]

Q1=1
Q2=3
Q3=4-1 =3
